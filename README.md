Linux Mirror Script by Thorian93
================================

This is a script that aims to synchronize Linux mirrors to a local mirror server.
It does this while trying to support all major distributions and staying flexible.
This script is developed and CentOS, it will not work on Debian based distributions without some adjustments if it works at all.

**Use at your own risk!**

This scripts assumes some prerequisites that I did not check, so please be careful when using the script!

Also this script is under heavy development currently and cannot be seen as stable, so don't rely on it! I am very open to suggestions and ideas, so please feel free to create [issues](https://github.com/thorian93/LinuxMirrorScript/issues) or [pull requests](https://github.com/thorian93/LinuxMirrorScript/pulls). :)
